# 📚 Recollective

> _Remember, Reflect, Rediscover._

**Recollective** is a personal archiving web app that helps you keep track of what you've read or watched — including books, movies, and dramas.  
It doesn’t just store your memories — it gives you insights, like total pages read in a year or your most-watched genre.
